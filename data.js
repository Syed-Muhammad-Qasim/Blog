    category: "Technology",
    description: "Quantum computing is poised to revolutionize problem-solving. Explore how this emerging tech works.",
    image: "/blogpost1.jpg",
    article: "Quantum computing represents a radical shift in computational power, utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that are practically impossible for classical computers. Unlike traditional bits, quantum bits or qubits can exist in multiple states at once (superposition) and can be entangled, allowing complex computations to be done in parallel. This makes quantum computers highly efficient for tasks like cryptography, optimization, drug discovery, and simulating quantum systems. Companies like IBM, Google, and startups like Rigetti and IonQ are racing to build reliable, scalable quantum hardware. As we move closer to quantum supremacy, this technology promises to unlock solutions to some of humanity’s most challenging problems.",
